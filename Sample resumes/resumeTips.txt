Who you are
What you've accomplished
Summary of skills

Aggregate totals

Employers are simple
	- they want to:
	• generate revenue
	• save costs
	• optimize the foundation, structure, processes
	  so that their company is healthy and successful;

What have you done that has had impact, and you're proud of?
^Not necessarily linked to *work*

People think in terms of time
they want to see a track record of
•achievements
•decisions youve made
•your evolution in, and across companies
THEY CANNOT DO THIS IF YOU LIST RESPONSABILITIES
	AT THE SAME LEVEL (INDENTATION) AS NAMES AND TITLES
try to indent the latter;

*try* to how a nice evolution across titles;

underneath the company name put a one sentence description
of what that company does, their goal, or their impact on the world;

under title
mini collection of highlights or responsabilities that you can give the person
without having to read ALL the bullets, DONT ASSUME THEYRE READING ALL OF THEM

◘THEY READ AN OUTLINE, ENTINCE THEM TO READ FURTHER;

Don't do this -> Activity based resumes which say what you were responsible for

•Do this -> Accomplishments benefits based resumes, which say what contribution or benefit was to
the company, clients, employees was.


Who are you
Who have you been
Where are you
Where have you been


◘Can someone who's not 100% in your field understand your resume?

Think about the road/role you're trying to go for, and then target your resume to apply to
that specific role;
For soft engineering you'd expect created, implemented, developed in xxxx;
Do tell what languages you're using in those descriptions.
◘High quality bullet points
Have very little bullet points, but describe them.
◘Be concise, prune out irrelevant info.



Structure in terms of:
challenges
accomplishments
results

In two months learned x language, met y deadline, implemented z, launched to some result
	generated revenue, used by some people, impact on the press,

use active verbs implementED, creatED, developed, launched, architected, led, design,

Don't mention only what your team did, what the project was, say what YOU did;

◘It's not about accomplishments, it's about the path you took to get them.
Explain what type of person you were as you went through your experiences, 
what your story was.
◘You had to learn something very quickly,
◘you had to work with a team and it was challenging,
◘you overcame conflict
◘accep feedback and change the product quickly, pivot, and take in reactions,
	iterated quickly,
◘techincal challenges, had to new sleugh of new technologies, and languages

***SINCE YOUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS ARE LITTLE, FOCUS ON YOUR PERSONALITY,
	CHARACTER, WORK ETHIC, PASSION FOR BUILDING, INITIATIVE, LEARNING NEW LANGUAGES, 
	PUTTING IN THE TIME, PICKING UP NEW TECHNOLOGIES, YOU'RE COLLABORATIVE, 
	COME UP WITH PROJECT IDEAS, HOOK UP API END POINTS, LEARN NEW TECHNOLOGIES



searchable, keywords
tech resume has a section with a bunch of keywords c++ java js mysql python php oC swift android iOS Angular Kotlin
	order those in from most experienced to least experienced


it's like photography, everyone can take a good picture, but the good photographers know
which picture is good, and only show that.

cover letters can be more casual;
